# Classification-of-Car-and-Bike--AI

   Classifies between a car and a bike using deep learning algorithm called Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with an accuracy of 96.4%.

## Outputs 
  Most of the outputs are command line based but for proof of image recognition the code displays the generated images when run in a localhost server
  
## Techologies Used:- 

- Python
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- sklearn(scikit-image)

## Installation:- 
   There is no particular installation just a python >3 is enough :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
